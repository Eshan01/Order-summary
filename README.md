## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid Box

### What I learned

Use of background image and position of the image in the background. I also learned to place a div in the centre of the website.

```css
body{
    background-image: url("./images/pattern-background-mobile.svg");
    background-repeat:repeat-x;
    background-size: 50%;
    background-position: top left;
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;
    background-color: var(--Pale-blue);
}
```


### Continued development

There are many things in CSS as well as in HTML. However, Flexbox and grid layout are some of the things which I want to improve.
